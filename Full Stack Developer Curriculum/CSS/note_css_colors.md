# Color Theory
Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other and how they affect our perception.

It covers color relationships, color harmony, and the psychological impact of color.

Colors can be classified as either primary, secondary, or tertiary.

## Primary colors
Primary colors, yellow, blue, and red, are the fundamental hues from which all other colors are derived.

## Secondary colors
Secondary colors result from mixing *equal amounts* of two primary colors. Green, orange, and purple are examples of secondary colors. For example *yellow + blue = green*

## Tertiary colors
Tertiary colors result from combining a primary color with a neighboring secondary color. Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, and Blue-Violet, are examples of tertiary colors.

This is a fundamental classification in the world of color theory, 
but there are other ways to classify colors. They can be classified as *warm or cool*, based on their temperature.

Warm colors, like reds, oranges, and yellows, evoke feelings of comfort, warmth, and coziness.

Cool colors, like blues, green, and purples, evoke feelings of calmness, serenity, and professionalism.

## Color Models
Colors can also be represented through color models. 

Frequently used color models include the RGB model, the HSV model, and the HSL model

## Fundamental tool that designers use to represent colors and their relationships.

The color wheel is a circular diagram that shows how colors relate to each other. 
It's an essential tool for designers because it helps them to select color combinations. 
This is very helpful for creating color palettes and color schemes.

## Color scheme:
A color scheme is the set of colors chosen for a specific design or project. 
They are usually based on the principles of color theory. 

### Analogous color schemes
Analogous color schemes create cohesive and soothing experiences. 
They have analogous colors, which are adjacent to each other in the color wheel.

- Analogous color schemes use three or more colors next to each other on the color wheel, creating harmonious, 
natural looks like red, red-orange, and orange (warm) or blue, blue-green, 
and green (cool), found in sunsets or nature scenes. 

     How They Work

*  Adjacent Colors: They are neighbors on the color wheel, sharing undertones that create a cohesive look, 
  like in a meadow or on a flower petal.

*  Harmony: The close relationship between the hues makes them blend beautifully, perfect for interiors, makeup, or branding.

*  Dominance: Typically, one color serves as the main focus, with the others as accents or support.

### Complementary color schemes

Complementary color schemes create high contrast and visual impact.

- Their colors are located on the opposite ends of the color wheel, relative to each other.

-  with classic examples being red & green, blue & orange, and yellow & purple, which pop when placed together, like red flowers on a green background.

- Variations include teal & coral, navy & orange, or forest green & deep red, creating vibrant or earthy moods for design, decor, and art. 

     Classic Complementary Pairs (RYB)
-  Red & Green: Think Christmas decor, autumn leaves, or a vibrant stop sign against foliage.

-  Blue & Orange: Like a bright sky against sunset, or sports teams such as the Denver Broncos.

-  Yellow & Purple: Sunflowers in a lavender field, or bold, cheerful designs.

     How They Work

-  High Contrast: They create visual excitement and make elements stand out.

-  Vibrancy: When next to each other, they intensify each other's brightness.

-  Shadows & Depth: Mixing them creates natural, darker tones, useful for adding shadows in painting. 

### Color contrast
Color contrast is essential for web accessibility. 
It ensures that text and other important elements are clearly distinguishable from their background. This is especially important for people with visual disabilities.

In an RGB color wheel, complementary colors are located at the opposite ends of the wheel.

### Triadic color scheme
A triadic color scheme has vibrant colors. 
They are made from colors that are approximately equidistant from each other. 
If they are connected, they form an equilateral triangle on the color wheel.

### The monochromatic color scheme:

In this color scheme, all the colors are derived from the same base color by 
adjusting its lightness, darkness, and saturation. This evokes a feeling of unity and harmony while still creating contrast.

## Some tips for using color effectively in web development:

1. Create a color scheme that defines your website's branding.
2. Use colors to evoke the emotions and perceptions that align with your goals.
3. Choose colors with enough contrast to make your website accessible for everyone.
4. Use color to highlight important elements of your website, like buttons.
5. Use color consistently and use it to create a visual hierarchy.

Color theory is a core aspect of design. 
By understanding color psychology, harmonies, and accessibility, you can create effective designs, evoke emotions, and enhance user experience.
